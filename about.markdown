I focus on finding economically efficient, environmentally friendly, and socially responsible solutions with real-world implications, which make systems, industries, and supply chains sustainable and resilient.</p> <p>My expertise lies in developing optimization, data science, and machine learning models to solve challenging business problems. By combining operations research and machine learning, I contribute to the fields of operations research and management science.</p> <p>I am eager to collaborate with industry leaders and fellow researchers to drive innovation and progress for systems, industries, and supply chains with sustainability and resiliency goals. I believe different problems require different ways of explaining or representing reality for a specific system, industry, or supply chain to obtain feasible, logical, and optimal solutions. I believe in algorithmizing, modeling, and solving problems in ways that are scalable, stable in computation time, and accurate. I am optimistic about the future of sustainable and resilient industries and supply chains and am committed to contributing to this vision.</p> <p>Some highlights of my achievements include the following:</p> <ul> <li>Experienced 4+ years of developing mathematical models that have real-world impacts</li> <li>Published papers in international journals and conferences such as JRESS, EAAI, CAIE, JRCS, and JMTM.</li> <li>Reviewed papers for prestigious journals, including ESWA, TRE, ASOC, ORP, CAOR, SCA, IJPR, SMCA, and JCDE.</li> <li>Received the Best Theoretical Thesis Award from the Iranian Institute of Industrial Engineering in 2020.</li> <li>Gained valuable real-world experience through involvement in industrial and business projects, including Supplier Relationship Management (Hamrah -e Avval), Visual Management (MAPNA TUGA), and Business and Big Data Analytics (SAPCO ISACO).</li> <li>Developed an integrated optimization environment in Python called FelooPy which supports exact and heuristic optimization, constraint programming, convex optimization, multi-objective optimization, and multi-criteria decision-making with the most straightforward optimization programming language possible, which uses around 400 algorithms.</li> <li>Experienced in working with Cplex, Gurobi, Xpress, Local Solver, GAMS, Pyomo, PuLP, Ortools, scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, typical for operations research and machine learning.</li> </ul> <div class="footer"> <p>Email: k.tafakkori [at] ut.ac.ir | LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keivan-tafakkori/" target="_blank">linkedin.com/in/keivan-tafakkori</a></p> </div> </div> </body> </html>
