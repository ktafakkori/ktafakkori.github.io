I am Keivan Tafakkori (M.Sc.). 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in industrial engineering at the University of Tehran, Iran. 

Since 2018, I have been a researcher in industrial engineering, focusing on logistics and supply chain management. 

I have a deep understanding of the mechanics of a system. I can aid you in designing decision-making models and applications that can convert your data to insights to significantly promote your business in terms of sustainability, resilience, digital transformation, and automation in industry 4.0 and 5.0 eras. 

I am currently studying artificial intelligence technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, etc., to leverage them in contribution to the operations research (OR) and management science (MS) fields (and contrariwise) both in theory and practice. 

Moreover, I have experience working with different programming languages such as MATLAB, Python, and C++.
