  <p>Hello!</p>

  <p>My name is Keivan Tafakkori and I am a Ph.D. candidate in industrial engineering at the University of Tehran, Iran.</p>

  <p>I have been interested in logistics and supply chain management since 2018, when I started my Masterâ€™s degree in industrial engineering. Since 2020, I have been exploring how to combine machine learning and operations research to solve supply chain, industry, and business problems more effectively.</p>

  <p>I have a deep understanding of the mechanics of a system and I can help you design decision-making models and applications that can transform your data into insights. I can help you improve your business performance in terms of sustainability, resilience, digital transformation, and automation in industry 4.0 and 5.0 eras.</p>

  <p>I have published several academic papers in prestigious journals, which you can access through this link: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=eoCLWfYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Google Scholar</a></p>

  <p>I am skilled in developing mathematical models for operations research (OR) and management science (MS) fields, both in theory and practice. I have developed an open-source integrated optimization environment in Python called <a href="https://github.com/ktafakkori/feloopy">FelooPy</a>, which enables operations research scientists to use among 15 optimization interfaces and 259 optimization algorithms using a single coding syntax.</p>

  <p>In addition, I have experience working with different programming languages and software, such as Python, GAMS, C/C++, Matlab, and Julia.</p>
