# Introduction

This article can serve as a comprehensive reference for practitioners, managers, consultants, academics, and experts to get familiar with use cases of operations research (OR) in different fields, such as industrial engineering (IE), computer science (CS), machine learning (ML), simulation (SM), and data science (DS).

You may not realize that there are over 1800 classes of decision problems that can be modeled using OR science both in the real world and in the virtual world. There is no doubt that the number of these classes can be more if we consider more specific practical, theoretical, or mathematical aspects. The theoretical categories of decision problems in OR can be created using the following features: 

* Online or offline
* Permanent, strategic, tactical, operational, rolling horizon, or real-time
* Deterministic or uncertain
* No-objective, single-objective with a linear function, single-objective with a nonlinear function, multi-objective with linear functions, or multi-objective with nonlinear functions 
* Continuous, discrete, or mixed decision variables 
* Unconstrained, single linear constraint, single nonlinear constraint, multiple linear constraints, or multiple nonlinear constraints

Notably, due to the diverse nature of OR's use cases, practical categories and use cases are difficult to categorize or measure. Therefore, this article will allude to keywords that can shed light on how decisions made by OR might be useful for a particular industry.
