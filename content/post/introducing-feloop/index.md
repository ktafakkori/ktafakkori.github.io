Welcome to FELOOP!

I am happy to share that I am initiating one of my personal projects called FELOOP (an abbreviation for FEasible, LOgical, and OPtimal) through this blog!

In this project, I will propose and share multiple approaches, models, algorithms, or codes for enthusiasts in the field of operations research (OR), computer science (CS), and data science (DS). In this blog, everything, even the most complex academic and business problems, theories, methodologies, and case studies, will be discussed in simple words, making it easy to follow for the audience. Therefore, please ensure to follow the updates and share the contents with your colleagues and friends!

Also, feel free to let me know your experience with the user interface of this blog.
