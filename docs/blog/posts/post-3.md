Documenting a new model, algorithm, policy, or method in technical writing, particularly when it encompasses a vast array of mathematical notations, can pose several challenges. By following a structured approach to presenting complex mathematical/statistical material, we can alleviate the burden of presentation overthinking and have a more coherent and accessible form of communication within the community.

Herein, I provide a list of references, that can be helpful:

1) Consistent notation for presenting complex optimization models in technical writing: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1876735416300186

2) INFORMS Operations Research author guidelines: https://pubsonline.informs.org/pb-assets/Mathnotationstextfinal.pdf
